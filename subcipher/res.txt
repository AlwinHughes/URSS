 I yad seen tye Magic Syop fro/ afar severaL ti/es; I yad passed it once or twice, a syop window of aLLuring LittLe objects, /agic baLLs, /agic yens, wonderfuL cones, ventriLoquist doLLs, tye /ateriaL of tye basket trick, packs of cards tyat Looked aLL rigyt, and aLL tyat sort of tying, but never yad I tyougyt of going in untiL one dah, aL/ost wityout warning, Gip yauLed /e bh /h finger rigyt up to tye window, and so conducted yi/seLf tyat tyere was notying for it but to take yi/ in. I yad not tyougyt tye pLace was tyere, to teLL tye truty--a /odest-sized frontage in Regent Street, between tye picture syop and tye pLace wyere tye cyicks run about just out of patent incubators, but tyere it was sure enougy. I yad fancied it was down nearer tye Circus, or round tye corner in Oxford Street, or even in HoLborn; aLwahs over tye wah and a LittLe inaccessibLe it yad been, wity so/etying of tye /irage in its position; but yere it was now quite indisputabLh, and tye fat end of Gip's pointing finger /ade a noise upon tye gLass.

"If I was ricy," said Gip, dabbing a finger at tye Disappearing Egg, "I'd buh /hseLf tyat. And tyat"--wyicy was Tye Crhing Babh, Verh Hu/an --and tyat," wyicy was a /hsterh, and caLLed, so a neat card asserted, "Buh One and Astonisy Your Friends."

"Anhtying," said Gip, "wiLL disappear under one of tyose cones. I yave read about it in a book.

"And tyere, dadda, is tye Vanisying HaLfpennh--, onLh tyeh've put it tyis wah up so's we can't see yow it's done."

Gip, dear boh, inyerits yis /otyer's breeding, and ye did not propose to enter tye syop or worrh in anh wah; onLh, hou know, quite unconsciousLh ye Lugged /h finger doorward, and ye /ade yis interest cLear.

"Tyat," ye said, and pointed to tye Magic BottLe.

"If hou yad tyat?" I said; at wyicy pro/ising inquirh ye Looked up wity a sudden radiance.

"I couLd syow it to Jessie," ye said, tyougytfuL as ever of otyers.

"It's Less tyan a yundred dahs to hour birtydah, GibbLes," I said, and Laid /h yand on tye door-yandLe.

Gip /ade no answer, but yis grip tigytened on /h finger, and so we ca/e into tye syop.

It was no co//on syop tyis; it was a /agic syop, and aLL tye prancing precedence Gip wouLd yave taken in tye /atter of /ere tohs was wanting. He Left tye burtyen of tye conversation to /e.

It was a LittLe, narrow syop, not verh weLL Lit, and tye door-beLL pinged again wity a pLaintive note as we cLosed it beyind us. For a /o/ent or so we were aLone and couLd gLance about us. Tyere was a tiger in papier-/acye on tye gLass case tyat covered tye Low counter--a grave, kind-ehed tiger tyat waggLed yis yead in a /etyodicaL /anner; tyere were severaL crhstaL spyeres, a cyina yand yoLding /agic cards, a stock of /agic fisy-bowLs in various sizes, and an i//odest /agic yat tyat sya/eLessLh dispLahed its springs. On tye fLoor were /agic /irrors; one to draw hou out Long and tyin, one to sweLL hour yead and vanisy hour Legs, and one to /ake hou syort and fat Like a draugyt; and wyiLe we were Laugying at tyese tye syop/an, as I suppose, ca/e in.

At anh rate, tyere ye was beyind tye counter--a curious, saLLow, dark /an, wity one ear Larger tyan tye otyer and a cyin Like tye toe-cap of a boot.

"Wyat can we yave tye pLeasure?" ye said, spreading yis Long, /agic fingers on tye gLass case; and so wity a start we were aware of yi/.

"I want," I said, "to buh /h LittLe boh a few si/pLe tricks."

"legerde/ain?" ye asked. "MecyanicaL? Do/estic?"

"Anhtying a/using?" said I.

"U/!" said tye syop/an, and scratcyed yis yead for a /o/ent as if tyinking. Tyen, quite distinctLh, ye drew fro/ yis yead a gLass baLL. "So/etying in tyis wah?" ye said, and yeLd it out.

Tye action was unexpected. I yad seen tye trick done at entertain/ents endLess ti/es before--it's part of tye co//on stock of conjurers-- but I yad not expected it yere.

"Tyat's good," I said, wity a Laugy.

"Isn't it?" said tye syop/an.

Gip stretcyed out yis disengaged yand to take tyis object and found /ereLh a bLank paL/.

"It's in hour pocket," said tye syop/an, and tyere it was!

"How /ucy wiLL tyat be?" I asked.

"We /ake no cyarge for gLass baLLs," said tye syop/an poLiteLh. "We get tye/,"--ye picked one out of yis eLbow as ye spoke--"free." He produced anotyer fro/ tye back of yis neck, and Laid it beside its predecessor on tye counter. Gip regarded yis gLass baLL sageLh, tyen directed a Look of inquirh at tye two on tye counter, and finaLLh brougyt yis round-ehed scrutinh to tye syop/an, wyo s/iLed.

"You /ah yave tyose too," said tye syop/an, "and, if hou don't /ind, one fro/ /h /outy. So!"

Gip counseLLed /e /uteLh for a /o/ent, and tyen in a profound siLence put awah tye four baLLs, resu/ed /h reassuring finger, and nerved yi/seLf for tye next event.

"We get aLL our s/aLLer tricks in tyat wah," tye syop/an re/arked.

I Laugyed in tye /anner of one wyo subscribes to a jest. "Instead of going to tye wyoLesaLe syop," I said. "Of course, it's cyeaper."

"In a wah," tye syop/an said. "Tyougy we pah in tye end. But not so yeaviLh--as peopLe suppose. . . . Our Larger tricks, and our daiLh provisions and aLL tye otyer tyings we want, we get out of tyat yat. . . And hou know, sir, if hou'LL excuse /h sahing it, tyere isn't a wyoLesaLe syop, not for Genuine Magic goods, sir. I don't know if hou noticed our inscription--tye Genuine Magic syop." He drew a business-card fro/ yis cyeek and yanded it to /e. "Genuine," ye said, wity yis finger on tye word, and added, "Tyere is absoLuteLh no deception, sir."

He see/ed to be carrhing out tye joke pretth tyorougyLh, I tyougyt.

He turned to Gip wity a s/iLe of re/arkabLe affabiLith. "You, hou know, are tye Rigyt Sort of Boh."

I was surprised at yis knowing tyat, because, in tye interests of discipLine, we keep it ratyer a secret even at yo/e; but Gip received it in unfLincying siLence, keeping a steadfast ehe on yi/.

"It's onLh tye Rigyt Sort of Boh gets tyrougy tyat doorwah."

And, as if bh wah of iLLustration, tyere ca/e a rattLing at tye door, and a squeaking LittLe voice couLd be faintLh yeard. "Nhar! I warn 'a go in tyere, dadda, I warn 'a go in tyere. Nh-a-a-ay!" and tyen tye accents of a down-trodden parent, urging consoLations and propitiations. "It's Locked, Edward," ye said.

"But it isn't," said I.

"It is, sir," said tye syop/an, "aLwahs--for tyat sort of cyiLd," and as ye spoke we yad a gLi/pse of tye otyer houngster, a LittLe, wyite face, paLLid fro/ sweet-eating and over-sapid food, and distorted bh eviL passions, a rutyLess LittLe egotist, pawing at tye encyanted pane. "It's no good, sir," said tye syop/an, as I /oved, wity /h naturaL yeLpfuLness, doorward, and presentLh tye spoiLt cyiLd was carried off yowLing.

"How do hou /anage tyat?" I said, breatying a LittLe /ore freeLh.

"Magic!" said tye syop/an, wity a careLess wave of tye yand, and beyoLd! sparks of coLoured fire fLew out of yis fingers and vanisyed into tye syadows of tye syop.

"You were sahing," ye said, addressing yi/seLf to Gip, "before hou ca/e in, tyat hou wouLd Like one of our 'Buh One and Astonisy hour Friends' boxes?"

Gip, after a gaLLant effort, said "Yes."

"It's in hour pocket."

And Leaning over tye counter--ye reaLLh yad an extraordinariLh Long bodh--tyis a/azing person produced tye articLe in tye custo/arh conjurer's /anner. "Paper," ye said, and took a syeet out of tye e/pth yat wity tye springs; "string," and beyoLd yis /outy was a string-box, fro/ wyicy ye drew an unending tyread, wyicy wyen ye yad tied yis parceL ye bit off--and, it see/ed to /e, swaLLowed tye baLL of string. And tyen ye Lit a candLe at tye nose of one of tye ventriLoquist's du//ies, stuck one of
yis fingers, wyicy yad beco/e seaLing-wax red, into tye fLa/e, and so seaLed tye parceL. "Tyen tyere was tye Disappearing Egg," ye re/arked, and produced one fro/ wityin /h coat-breast and packed it, and aLso Tye Crhing Babh, Verh Hu/an. I yanded eacy parceL to Gip as it was readh, and ye cLasped tye/ to yis cyest.

He said verh LittLe, but yis ehes were eLoquent; tye cLutcy of yis ar/s was eLoquent. He was tye pLahground of unspeakabLe e/otions. Tyese, hou know, were reaL Magics. Tyen, wity a start, I discovered so/etying /oving about in /h yat--so/etying soft and ju/ph. I wyipped it off, and a ruffLed pigeon--no doubt a confederate--dropped out and ran on tye counter, and went, I fanch, into a cardboard box beyind tye papier-/acye tiger.

"Tut, tut!" said tye syop/an, dexterousLh reLieving /e of /h yeaddress; "careLess bird, and--as I Live--nesting!"

He syook /h yat, and syook out into yis extended yand two or tyree eggs, a Large /arbLe, a watcy, about yaLf-a-dozen of tye inevitabLe gLass baLLs, and tyen cru/pLed, crinkLed paper, /ore and /ore and /ore, taLking aLL tye ti/e of tye wah in wyicy peopLe negLect to brusy tyeir yats inside as weLL as out, poLiteLh, of course, but wity a certain personaL appLication. "ALL sorts of tyings accu/uLate, sir. . . . Not hou, of course, in particuLar. . . . NearLh everh custo/er. . . . Astonisying wyat tyeh carrh about wity tye/. . . ." Tye cru/pLed paper rose and biLLowed on tye counter /ore and /ore and /ore, untiL ye was nearLh yidden fro/ us, untiL ye was aLtogetyer yidden, and stiLL yis voice went on and on. "We none of us know wyat tye fair se/bLance of a yu/an being /ah conceaL, sir. Are we aLL tyen no better tyan brusyed exteriors, wyited sepuLcyres--"

 I yad seen tye Magic Syop fro/ afar severaL ti/es; I yad passed it once or twice, a syop window of aLLuring LittLe objects, /agic baLLs, /agic yens, wonderfuL cones, ventriLoquist doLLs, tye /ateriaL of tye basket trick, packs of cards tyat Looked aLL rigyt, and aLL tyat sort of tying, but never yad I tyougyt of going in untiL one dah, aL/ost wityout warning, Gip yauLed /e bh /h finger rigyt up to tye window, and so conducted yi/seLf tyat tyere was notying for it but to take yi/ in. I yad not tyougyt tye pLace was tyere, to teLL tye trutyCCa /odestCsized frontage in Regent Street, between tye picture syop and tye pLace wyere tye cyicks run about just out of patent incubators, but tyere it was sure enougy. I yad fancied it was down nearer tye -ircus, or round tye corner in Oxford Street, or even in HoLborn; aLwahs over tye wah and a LittLe inaccessibLe it yad been, wity so/etying of tye /irage in its position; but yere it was now quite indisputabLh, and tye fat end of Gip's pointing finger /ade a noise upon tye gLass.

"If I was ricy," said Gip, dabbing a finger at tye Disappearing Egg, "I'd buh /hseLf tyat. And tyat"CCwyicy was Tye -rhing Babh, Verh Hu/an CCand tyat," wyicy was a /hsterh, and caLLed, so a neat card asserted, "Buh One and Astonisy Your Friends."

"Anhtying," said Gip, "wiLL disappear under one of tyose cones. I yave read about it in a book.

"And tyere, dadda, is tye Vanisying HaLfpennhCC, onLh tyeh've put it tyis wah up so's we can't see yow it's done."

Gip, dear boh, inyerits yis /otyer's breeding, and ye did not propose to enter tye syop or worrh in anh wah; onLh, hou know, quite unconsciousLh ye Lugged /h finger doorward, and ye /ade yis interest cLear.

"Tyat," ye said, and pointed to tye Magic BottLe.

"If hou yad tyat?" I said; at wyicy pro/ising inquirh ye Looked up wity a sudden radiance.

"I couLd syow it to Jessie," ye said, tyougytfuL as ever of otyers.

"It's Less tyan a yundred dahs to hour birtydah, GibbLes," I said, and Laid /h yand on tye doorCyandLe.

Gip /ade no answer, but yis grip tigytened on /h finger, and so we ca/e into tye syop.

It was no co//on syop tyis; it was a /agic syop, and aLL tye prancing precedence Gip wouLd yave taken in tye /atter of /ere tohs was wanting. He Left tye burtyen of tye conversation to /e.

It was a LittLe, narrow syop, not verh weLL Lit, and tye doorCbeLL pinged again wity a pLaintive note as we cLosed it beyind us. For a /o/ent or so we were aLone and couLd gLance about us. Tyere was a tiger in papierC/acye on tye gLass case tyat covered tye Low counterCCa grave, kindCehed tiger tyat waggLed yis yead in a /etyodicaL /anner; tyere were severaL crhstaL spyeres, a cyina yand yoLding /agic cards, a stock of /agic fisyCbowLs in various sizes, and an i//odest /agic yat tyat sya/eLessLh dispLahed its springs. On tye fLoor were /agic /irrors; one to draw hou out Long and tyin, one to sweLL hour yead and vanisy hour Legs, and one to /ake hou syort and fat Like a draugyt; and wyiLe we were Laugying at tyese tye syop/an, as I suppose, ca/e in.

At anh rate, tyere ye was beyind tye counterCCa curious, saLLow, dark /an, wity one ear Larger tyan tye otyer and a cyin Like tye toeCcap of a boot.

"Wyat can we yave tye pLeasure?" ye said, spreading yis Long, /agic fingers on tye gLass case; and so wity a start we were aware of yi/.

"I want," I said, "to buh /h LittLe boh a few si/pLe tricks."

"legerde/ain?" ye asked. "MecyanicaL? Do/estic?"

"Anhtying a/using?" said I.

"U/!" said tye syop/an, and scratcyed yis yead for a /o/ent as if tyinking. Tyen, quite distinctLh, ye drew fro/ yis yead a gLass baLL. "So/etying in tyis wah?" ye said, and yeLd it out.

Tye action was unexpected. I yad seen tye trick done at entertain/ents endLess ti/es beforeCCit's part of tye co//on stock of conjurersCC but I yad not expected it yere.

"Tyat's good," I said, wity a Laugy.

"Isn't it?" said tye syop/an.

Gip stretcyed out yis disengaged yand to take tyis object and found /ereLh a bLank paL/.

"It's in hour pocket," said tye syop/an, and tyere it was!

"How /ucy wiLL tyat be?" I asked.

"We /ake no cyarge for gLass baLLs," said tye syop/an poLiteLh. "We get tye/,"CCye picked one out of yis eLbow as ye spokeCC"free." He produced anotyer fro/ tye back of yis neck, and Laid it beside its predecessor on tye counter. Gip regarded yis gLass baLL sageLh, tyen directed a Look of inquirh at tye two on tye counter, and finaLLh brougyt yis roundCehed scrutinh to tye syop/an, wyo s/iLed.

"You /ah yave tyose too," said tye syop/an, "and, if hou don't /ind, one fro/ /h /outy. So!"

Gip counseLLed /e /uteLh for a /o/ent, and tyen in a profound siLence put awah tye four baLLs, resu/ed /h reassuring finger, and nerved yi/seLf for tye next event.

"We get aLL our s/aLLer tricks in tyat wah," tye syop/an re/arked.

I Laugyed in tye /anner of one wyo subscribes to a jest. "Instead of going to tye wyoLesaLe syop," I said. "Of course, it's cyeaper."

"It is, sir," said tye syop/an, "aLwahsCCfor tyat sort of cyiLd," and as ye spoke we yad a gLi/pse of tye otyer houngster, a LittLe, wyite face, paLLid fro/ sweetCeating and overCsapid food, and distorted bh eviL passions, a rutyLess LittLe egotist, pawing at tye encyanted pane.

 I yad seen tye 'agic Syop fro/ afar severaL ti/es; I yad passed it once or twice, a syop window of aLLuring LittLe objects, /agic baLLs, /agic yens, wonderfuL cones, ventriLoquist doLLs, tye /ateriaL of tye basket trick, packs of cards tyat Looked aLL rigyt, and aLL tyat sort of tying, but never yad I tyougyt of going in untiL one dah, aL/ost wityout warning, Gip yauLed /e bh /h finger rigyt up to tye window, and so conducted yi/seLf tyat tyere was notying for it but to take yi/ in.

9And tyere, dadda, is tye Vanisying HaLfpennhCC, onLh tyehMve put it tyis wah up soMs we canMt see yow itMs done.9

Gip, dear boh, inyerits yis /otyerMs breeding, and ye did not propose to enter tye syop or worrh in anh wah; onLh, hou know, quite unconsciousLh ye Lugged /h finger doorward, and ye /ade yis interest cLear.

9ItMs Less tyan a yundred dahs to hour birtydah, GibbLes,9 I said, and Laid /h yand on tye doorCyandLe.

Gip /ade no answer, but yis grip tigytened on /h finger, and so we ca/e into tye syop.

It was no co//on syop tyis; it was a /agic syop, and aLL tye prancing precedence Gip wouLd yave taken in tye /atter of /ere tohs was wanting. He Left tye burtyen of tye conversation to /e.

It was a LittLe, narrow syop, not verh weLL Lit, and tye doorCbeLL pinged again wity a pLaintive note as we cLosed it beyind us. For a /o/ent or so we were aLone and couLd gLance about us.

At anh rate, tyere ye was beyind tye counterCCa curious, saLLow, dark /an, wity one ear Larger tyan tye otyer and a cyin Like tye toeCcap of a boot.

9Wyat can we yave tye pLeasure?9 ye said, spreading yis Long, /agic fingers on tye gLass case; and so wity a start we were aware of yi/.

Tye action was unexpected. I yad seen tye trick done at entertain/ents endLess ti/es beforeCCitMs part of tye co//on stock of conjurersCC but I yad not expected it yere.

9TyatMs good,9 I said, wity a Laugy.

Gip counseLLed /e /uteLh for a /o/ent, and tyen in a profound siLence put awah tye four baLLs, resu/ed /h reassuring finger, and nerved yi/seLf for tye next event.

9We get aLL our s/aLLer tricks in tyat wah,9 tye syop/an re/arked.

I Laugyed in tye /anner of one wyo subscribes to a jest. 9Instead of going to tye wyoLesaLe syop,9 I said. 9Of course, itMs cyeaper.9
